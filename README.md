## About this project

This project is to create a github profile page clone to display the repositories and allow the user to filter through the repositories by name using a search bar.

> Followed MVC Structure through full project.

> Used CSS Modules, which makes easy to call css classes and ids without any clash of its names across project.

### Using custom react hooks (usehttp) for API Calls
